# Fork Info
Thanks to richbira for the original app!
I'm planning to connect it with Notion to auto-update my tasks when I finish a pomodoro session on them.

I also converter it to CTk, because I like it's modern style.

# Pomodoro Timer GUI App üçÖ
How to become more productive!

Welcome to the Pomodoro (Tomato) Timer GUI app! This application is designed to help you become more productive by using the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique involves working on a task for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro") and then taking a short 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 minutes. This cycle helps improve focus and productivity.

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richbira/Pomodoro.git
```

Run the Application
Navigate to the "dist" folder and open the main.exe file.

Install Playsound

```bash
pip install playsound
```

Open the command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install playsound
```

# How to use Pomodoro/ Tomato timers
1) Decide on the task you want to accomplish.
2) Set the timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro) and start working on the task.
3) When the timer completes, take a 5-minute short break.
4) After completing four Pomodoros, take a 15-minute long break.
5) Repeat the process from step 1.

- Final Result: You have worked for 100 minutes and took 15 minutes break!

PS: There is also a motivational quote that will help you on being productive! :)
